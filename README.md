# Pacman-AI-Contest
This repository holds the recording related to my team, It_Depends, in RMITs AI pacman contest of semester 1 2017. 
Due to restrictions from the host, UC Berkeley I am unable to share the code used to create the team. as such I am hosting the recording and the code provided by UC Berkeley to view the replays.
Original contest design and specifications are available at http://ai.berkeley.edu/contest.html
